# Meeting manager

## What is this?

This is one of my lab at the university (my 5th, 6th and 7th lab in programming). But I think it was interesting so I extended it
a little bit more and now it is looks like a pet project to me.

## But really, what is this?
This is an app that manage meetings, but not really. The main purpose of this app is just for practicing. So there will be features that missing,
but also features that does not need :stuck_out_tongue:. Still you can add and remove meetings, sort the meetings. Other features
is below.

## Features
- Allow user to add/remove a meetings with JSON input from keyboard via CLI.

- It can be run with a client and server app separately or run combine both client and server into one app.

- Users can register accounts (and verify the account via email), create collections of meetings and store them into the database.

- Users can also view the collections of other user. They can also modify and store that list as their own. 

- If you don't want to create an account, you can still use the app.
Your progress can be stored and restored with file view commands `import` and `export` with CSV file format.
