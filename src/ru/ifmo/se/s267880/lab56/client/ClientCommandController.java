     * A method to remove <code>JsonParser.NON_EXECUTE_PREFIX</code>'s content.
     *
     * <p>This method is a hack.</p>
     *
     * <h6>The problem.</h6>
     * <p>
     *     My task asks me to implements some commands, and one of them has 2 type of argument: a json object and a number.
     *     We all know that a raw number is also a valid Json object, so all I need is just read the Json object.
     *     But Google is so smart: when reading a number with 1 digit, Gson tries to read 4 more in order to find out whether
     *     or not the Json string contains a string called
     *     <a href="https://google.github.io/gson/apidocs/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#nonexecuteprefix">
     *         "non execute prefix"
     *     </a> for security reason. So in order to execute the current command, the user need to enter 3 more character,
     *     (because they already hit enter, an '\n' is read).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     Of course the easiest solution for the above problem is to check if the first non-whitespace character is a
     *     number or is an open brace. But the second problem is that I want the command to be execute with more than
     *     one arguments. For example we want an command to insert an object into a specific place in a collection,
     *     so we need 2 arguments. And the problem now, is when using JsonReader or JsonParser, for the sake of the speed,
     *     the reader will try to read all the lines, into its buffer, so there is "almost" no way to get the next data
     *     in the same line after an argument is read, unless, using the JsonParser itself to read more.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     And also because of its fancy function, gson can read unquoted string, so I also use JsonParser as both of my
     *     reader: the command reader and the input reader.
     * </p>
     * <h6>The solution.</h6>
     * <p>
     *     Because this is a small project, and currently not related to the internet, so this method was made so it can
     *     remove the content of the "non execute prefix" in the JsonReader object. That way, the commands is more
     *     freely to read the user input, and JsonParser is still safe and not malfunction.
     * </p>
     * <p>To archive this, reflection is used with a little help of online code that suspend the looger (so it will look nicer).</p>
